# MyDFIR-SOC-Analyst-challenge

## Introduction

This document outlines my participation in the MyDFIR 30-Day SOC Analyst Challenge, created by Steven at MyDFIR.com. This free initiative aims to equip aspiring SOC analysts with practical skills over a 30-day period.

## Day 1
On Day 1, I developed a logical diagram using draw.io to illustrate the network architecture for this challenge.

The diagram features a VULTR VPC comprising six servers:

- Windows Server (RDP Enabled)
- Ubuntu Server (SSH Enabled)
- Fleet Server
- Elastic & Kibana Server
- osTicket Server
- C2 Server

## Day 2
On Day 2, I learned about the ELK STACK
E - Elasticsearch
L - Logstash
K - Kibana

### Elasticsearch 
- I will use Elasticsearch to store logs, including Windows event logs, syslogs, and firewall logs, allowing for real-time analysis of large data volumes. Itâ€™s often used with Kibana, which visualizes the data for better insights.

### Logstash
- Logstash is an open-source tool that collects and processes data from various sources, such as logs and events. I will use Logstash with Elastic Agents to gather, transform, and send data to Elasticsearch, simplifying the analysis and visualization of logs with Kibana.

### Kibana
- Using Kibana with Elasticsearch will allow me to explore, analyze, and visualize data through interactive dashboards and real-time graphs.
  
<!--Logs from the Windows and Ubuntu servers will be forwarded to the Elastic & Kibana server via designated agents.
