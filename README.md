# MyDFIR-SOC-Analyst-challenge

## Introduction

This document outlines my participation in the MyDFIR 30-Day SOC Analyst Challenge, created by Steven at MyDFIR.com. This free initiative aims to equip aspiring SOC analysts with practical skills over a 30-day period.

## Day 1
On Day 1, I developed a logical diagram using draw.io to illustrate the network architecture for this challenge.

The diagram features a VULTR VPC comprising six servers:

- Windows Server (RDP Enabled)
- Ubuntu Server (SSH Enabled)
- Fleet Server
- Elastic & Kibana Server
- osTicket Server
- C2 Server

## Day 2
On Day 2, I learned about the ELK STACK
- Elasticsearch
- Logstash
- Kibana

### Elasticsearch 
- Elasticsearch is a free, open-source tool designed for fast data search and analysis. It organizes data effectively, making it easy to locate the information you need. I will be using it to store Windows event logs, syslogs, and firewall logs, allowing me to sift through large volumes of data in real time. Itâ€™s commonly used alongside Kibana, which helps visualize the data for better insights.
<!--Logs from the Windows and Ubuntu servers will be forwarded to the Elastic & Kibana server via designated agents.
